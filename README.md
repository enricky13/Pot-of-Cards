If you want to check the progress of this app check out my Trello Board:

Project Overview:
This app will make a network call to an API that will end up displaying a list of Yugioh Cards for the user to examine. There will also be filters in case you need to look for a specific card or a type of card. There may also be a life point counter where you can keep track of live games with your friends if you need a quick calculator for the game, it will come with other game related elements to give players a better experience without using other resources.
